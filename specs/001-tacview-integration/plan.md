# Implementation Plan: Tacview Integration

**Branch**: `001-tacview-integration` | **Date**: 2025-10-26 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-tacview-integration/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

**Primary Requirement**: Real-time vehicle tracking system that automatically detects spawned vehicles in Stormworks and transmits their position data to Tacview for tactical visualization and analysis.

**Technical Approach**: Event-driven vehicle tracking using Stormworks spawn/despawn callbacks, periodic position updates every 6 ticks (0.1 seconds), ACMI protocol formatting with Base64 encoding, and HTTP transmission to a bridge server that forwards data to Tacview. All implementation contained within a single script.lua file using pure Lua without external dependencies.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Lua 5.4 (Stormworks subset)  
**Primary Dependencies**: None - self-contained code only, no LifeBoatAPI  
**Storage**: Stormworks property system and save/load callbacks  
**Testing**: Creative mode simulation and gameplay scenarios  
**Target Platform**: Stormworks game environment (Windows/Linux)
**Project Type**: Stormworks addon - single script.lua file  
**Performance Goals**: Complete execution within tick budget, responsive gameplay  
**Constraints**: No setmetatable(), no require(), tick-based execution model  
**Scale/Scope**: Single addon, single file, game performance critical

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

- [x] **Self-Contained Code**: All implementation fits in single script.lua file

  - ✅ Base64 encoder implemented in pure Lua
  - ✅ ACMI formatting using only built-in string operations
  - ✅ HTTP requests via Stormworks server.httpGet() API
  - ✅ No external dependencies or require() statements

- [x] **Simple Table Architecture**: No setmetatable() usage, plain table structures only

  - ✅ Vehicle tracking uses plain table registry (g_tracked_vehicles)
  - ✅ ACMI data structures use simple table composition
  - ✅ No metamethods or complex object-oriented patterns

- [x] **Tick-Based Performance**: No blocking operations, computations split across ticks

  - ✅ Position updates batched every 6 ticks (0.1 seconds)
  - ✅ HTTP requests are fire-and-forget (non-blocking)
  - ✅ Vehicle spawn/despawn handled in callbacks (event-driven)
  - ✅ All operations designed to complete within tick budget

- [x] **State Management Discipline**: Proper use of Stormworks property/save systems

  - ✅ No persistent state required (vehicle tracking resets on reload)
  - ✅ Session state managed through global variables
  - ✅ Automatic cleanup on addon reload via Stormworks behavior

- [x] **Testing Through Simulation**: Testable scenarios in creative mode defined
  - ✅ Single vehicle spawn/tracking verification
  - ✅ Multi-vehicle simultaneous tracking test
  - ✅ Vehicle despawn cleanup verification
  - ✅ Network resilience testing (bridge server offline)
  - ✅ Performance testing with 50 vehicle benchmark (no hard limit enforced)

# Testing Structure (Creative Mode Simulation)
Testing performed through Stormworks creative mode scenarios:
- Vehicle spawn/despawn lifecycle testing
- Real-time position tracking verification
- Multi-vehicle simultaneous tracking
- Network resilience validation
- Performance testing with vehicle limits
```

**Structure Decision**: Single-file addon architecture chosen to comply with Stormworks constraints and constitution requirements. All Tacview integration logic, Base64 encoding, ACMI formatting, and HTTP communication implemented within script.lua. No external dependencies or modular structure permitted by Stormworks addon system.
